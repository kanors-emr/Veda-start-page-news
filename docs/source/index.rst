`Version History <https://veda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/version_history.html>`_

.. note::
    **[Alert]** Any users of **TIMES v455–v457** are advised to upgrade to **TIMES v4.5.8**. In versions v455–v457 a capacity lower bound CAP_BND(LO) may be erroneously ignored if CAP_BND(UP) is also defined for the same process in the same period. It would be prudent to delete these versions, to prevent their inadvertent use with saved cases.
