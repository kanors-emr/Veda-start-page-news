 I encourage users to update to version 220 as it has important enhancements and bug fixes.

Announcements:
   * We have emailed permanent license keys to "license admins" for all users. Let us know if you intend to use Veda2.0 and did not receive a key yet.
   * Installers will be `available on Github <https://github.com/kanors-emr/Veda2.0-Installation>`_ from now on.
   * Data GDX files that are imported automatically after each run are taking too much space in the database. I suggest that users delete data GDX information from the database periodically till we fix this issue (Model - Manage disc space - database.. GDX tab). The original GDX files will be available in "\Gamssave\" anyway, so they can be imported when needed (Tools - Import GDX Files).
