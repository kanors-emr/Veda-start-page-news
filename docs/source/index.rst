Version `231 has been released<https://github.com/kanors-emr/Veda2.0-Installation>`_.

Announcements:
   * I encourage users to update to version 230 (or higher). Major enhancements - batch sync and backup/restore state will make it a lot easier to upgrade versions.
   * We have emailed permanent license keys to "license admins" for all users. Let us know if you intend to use Veda2.0 and did not receive a key yet.
