    **Users of TIMES code versions 455, 456, and 457 are requested to download version 458. It would be prudent to delete these versions, to prevent their inadvertent use with saved cases.**

`Version 242 <https://github.com/kanors-emr/Veda2.0-Installation>`_ has been released.

   * **Reports functionality will be available under all license types till 31 Dec 21**.
   * `ETSAP webinar <https://youtu.be/ri6asoxXcRg>`_ on setting up Report definitions file and using the Reports browser in Veda2.0.
   * `Reports <https://veda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/Reports.html>`_ section has been added in Veda documentation. It should be a welcome relief for those relying on "Update Excel", after some investment in setting this up in the new environment.
   * If you are using version 230 or higher, you can use "Backup State" under Model menu. "Restore State" under higher will Re-synchronize all models and import all VD files that were a part of the old version.

.. note::
    **Migrating models to Veda2.0 requires familiarity with the model database and Veda_FE/BE. Users are requested to NOT delegate this task to new members of the team.**
