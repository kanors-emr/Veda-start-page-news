`Version 234 <https://github.com/kanors-emr/Veda2.0-Installation>`_ has been released.

   * If you are using version 230 or 231, you can use "Backup State" under Model menu. "Restore State" under version 232 will Re-synchronize all models and import all VD files that were a part of the old version.
   * We encourage users to update to version 230 (or higher). Major enhancements - batch sync and backup/restore state will make it a lot easier to upgrade versions.

.. note::
    **Migrating models to Veda2.0 requires familiarity with the model database and Veda_FE/BE. Users are requested to NOT delegate this task to new members of the team.**
