 Version 225 has PostgreSQL server connection issues on some machines. Please wait for version 226.

Announcements:
   * I encourage users to update to version 225/226. Enhancements in layout will improve the Browse experience significantly.

   * Installers will be `available on Github <https://github.com/kanors-emr/Veda2.0-Installation>`_ from now on.
